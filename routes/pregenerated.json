Currently robot arms are expensive or small and weak, or clumpy. \r\nIndustrial robots are expensive and dangerous and for that not suitable for using at home or schools. \r\nA Open Source printable robot can build,used and developed by every one. \r\nRobots are still expensive and hard to operate, but this must not longer be the case. \r\nA cheap 3d printed robot arm could be used by disabled persons to manage their daily needs better and more independent. Operate at dangerous but not so developed places. \r\nRemote controlled you could even us the robot to open your door if you forgot your keys.\r\n\r\nThe future Arm will include a moving base. \r\n",

However in industrial automation, brushless servomotors have taken over, and it&apos;s clear why: They don&apos;t lose steps, are much more powerful, efficient, and silent.\r\n\r\nHowever, brushless motors are not unique to expensive industrial automation equipment. In fact, you can get some very powerful and cheap motors at hobby shops. The electronics to drive these motors are also dirt cheap. So how come virtually no non-industrial automation systems use them?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I have no idea. Seriously, a driver that allows this should clearly exist.\r\nBut since it didn&apos;t, I decided to make one.\r\n\r\nAnd you are invited!\r\nThis project is open source, both in hardware and software, and I warmly welcome anyone who wants to join.",

Since 3D printers are easy to use and low cost, they allow anyone to make incredibly complex things. I&apos;m confident that anyone reading this has seen something cool made on a low cost hobby grade 3D printer. The technology has opened up new doors to makers and hackers.\r\n\r\nHowever the capabilities of 3D printers are limited by requirement of human operation. The need of manual part removal prevents 3D printers from being used for mass production purposes. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to build a fully autonomous 3D printer. A 3D printer that can print a continuous stream of parts without user interaction. The finished machine is capable of independently ejecting and starting print jobs. Additional, the 3D printer&apos;s conveyor belt mechanism allows it make infinitely long prints.",

Only little we realize that the device that we rigorously use daily hasn&apos;t changed much, remains &apos;dumb&apos; as it was first invented. With more and more freaking-tasks often need to be handled simultaneously, we still rely heavily on our lazy-brain telling our hand to type here &amp; there. We often end up inputting the same damn-password so many times because most of those safe-secure password keeper are just too complicated to startup. No matter what we are doing, what&apos;s happening in the surrounding, how late you are staying up the night, our keyboard remains the way it always is, doesn&apos;t help a thing and I&apos;M GETTING SICK OF IT!",

The six stator poles are spiral traces wounded in a star configuration. Although these coils produce less torque compared to an iron core stator, the motor is still suitable for high-speed applications. \r\n\r\nIt also has a 16mm diameter, 1.7mm thin 3d printed 4-pole rotor. So the total thickness of this axial flux motor adds up to 5mm (excluding the shaft) and weighs 1.5 grams. \r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this idea came from trying to build smaller and cheaper drone. Making the motor onto the PCB itself will reduce the overall price of any tiny robot, allowing swarm robotics to become more affordable.",

In addition, the automation gateway can historize and chart sensor data, react to sensor values (send emails, do android push or iphone prowl notification, etc...), as well as control existing commercial products you may already own (Sonos speakers, WEMO, Insteon, z-wave devices).\r\n\r\nI've made the design as flexible as I know how.

We put quadrature optical encoders on each axis since stepper motors don&apos;t have encoders and they sometimes skip if not strong enough. Having these encoders allows the FPGA microcontroller on Dexter to poll the sensors fast enough and correct the motor&apos;s position in real time. Thanks to our gateware, we can poll each axis 5 million times per second, creating a 200 nanosecond feedback loop. Dexter is licensed under GPL3 so the design can be reproduced and modified at will. All of our files are on our OnShape, GitHub, and Thingiverse and a link to the building manual is in the build instructions.",

Beautiful typography, endearing glow, and very clever technology. But when commercial production stopped in the 1990s, prices for surplus Nixie Tubes began to rise. Smaller tubes like the IN-16 are still only about $3.50/piece, but bigger and more desirable tubes like the IN-18 can run up to $45/piece. If you wanted to make a 6-digit clock, it can cost up to $270 just for the tubes! And they&apos;re potentially dangerous. And they might &quot;burn out&quot; next week. And they need special switching circuitry. And they&apos;re old news. So let&apos;s modernize the Nixie Tube!",

This project includes features such as software calibration, programmatic control via USB Raw HID, etc.  In its simplest form, it is very affordable, but can be easily scaled up to a larger, more powerful unit.",

The idea comes from utilizing technology to give you a super ability such as wireless control devices by moving a single finger, sense electromagnetic fields, and even scan RFID keys while all being stored inside your body. While these are a few examples, the possibilities range much further. It's also a user-integrated hacker tool that has the opportunity to change life as we know it.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the B10N1C is to explore the application of a small, safe, robust implant that communicates with the outside world through technology and the various user interfaces found in one’s day to day life.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project hinges on the idea of becoming bionically similar to Robocop. Using my knowledge of implantable materials (silicone, polyurethane, etc), I hope to upgrade my body to communicate with the tech-friendly culture that we live in today.",

The semi-transparent mirror was extracted from Eye of Horus Beamsplitter, and the projection lens is cut from a plastic 3x Fresnel magnifying lens. The box and mounting parts are 3D-printed from ABS. Head strap is for GoPro. One RPi USB port is used for WiFi, and second for 2.4Ghz small wireless keyboard/mouse combo. All together cost around 100$. I haven't figured out a good option for the power supply yet, and don't know if this thing can have a practical application. The display driver is fbtft framebuffer, so both text and (non-accelerated) graphical modes are possible, but with 320x240 resolution using X is not too exciting. Display brightness is sufficient if ambient light is not too bright.\r\n\r\nHere is a demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCYnIHqwIJU",
